  <h1>The Marauder's Mapp</h1>
  <h2>PennApps XIII - January 2016</h2>  
  <h4><b>About this app: </b>Ever wondering where your friends are around the UPenn campus? You can now find them using the Marauder's Mapp! A technological spoof on the Marauder's Map from the Harry Potter series, it includes voice activation to open ("I solemnly swear that I am up to no good") and to close ("Mischief managed") the map. You can add/delete other users to your friend list, which pop up on the map in Harry Potter style (footprints and a parchment scroll that displays the user's name when tapped upon).</h4>  
  <h4><b>Awards: </b>PennApps Top 30, Devpost Staff Pick</h4>
