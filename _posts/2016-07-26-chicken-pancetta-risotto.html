<p style= "color:black">
<b>Servings:</b> 4 (with plenty of leftovers!)
<br>
<br>
<b>Ingredients:</b>
<ul>
  <li>6 boneless skinless chicken thighs, diced into large pieces</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Coarsly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 onion, diced</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves, finely diced</li>
  <li>6 slices pancetta, diced</li>
  <li>1 and 3/4 cups Jasmati white rice</li>
  <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
  <li>3 and 1/2 cups chicken stock</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>2 cups frozen peas</li>
  <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
</ul>
<b>Directions:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Season the diced chicken well with salt and pepper to taste and stir to combine.</li>
  <li>Press ‘Chicken/Meat’ to preheat the pressure cooker. As it heats up, add the oil, and 1 tablesppon of the butter to the inner pot. Once melted, saute the onion, garlic, and pancetta for about 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Working quickly, stir in the chicken, rice, wine, and chicken stock. Season with the red pepper flakes and oregano. Press ‘Stop/cancel’.</li>
  <li>Press the ‘Rice/Risotto’ cooking button, and adjust the time to 8 minutes. Stir the risotto once more, and seal the lid.</li>
  <li>Microwave the peas in a separate bowl until hot, and set aside.</li>
  <li>At the end of the cooking time, quick release the pressure. Vigorously stir the risotto to develop the creamy texture, and mix in the parmesan and remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. Then add in the peas and stir to combine. Leave to stand in the pressure cooker for several minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve topped with extra parmesan and black pepper to taste.</li>
</ol>
