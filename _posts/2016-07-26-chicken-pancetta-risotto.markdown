Servings: 4 (with plenty of leftovers!)

Ingredients:
-   6 boneless skinless chicken thighs, diced into large pieces
-   Salt
- Coarsly ground black pepper
-4 tablespoons unsalted butter
-1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
-1 onion, diced
-3 garlic cloves, finely diced
-6 slices pancetta, diced
-1 and 3/4 cups Jasmati white rice
-1/2 cup white wine
-3 and 1/2 cups chicken stock
-1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
-1 teaspoon dried oregano
-2 cups frozen peas
-1/4 cup grated parmesan

Directions:
1. Season the diced chicken well with salt and pepper to taste and stir to combine.
2. Press ‘Chicken/Meat’ to preheat the pressure cooker. As it heats up, add the oil, and 1 tablesppon of the butter to the inner pot. Once melted, saute the onion, garlic, and pancetta for about 2 minutes.
3. Working quickly, stir in the chicken, rice, wine, and chicken stock. Season with the red pepper flakes and oregano. Press ‘Stop/cancel’.
4. Press the ‘Rice/Risotto’ cooking button, and adjust the time to 8 minutes. Stir the risotto once more, and seal the lid.
5. Microwave the peas in a separate bowl until hot, and set aside.
6. At the end of the cooking time, quick release the pressure. Vigorously stir the risotto to develop the creamy texture, and mix in the parmesan and remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. Then add in the peas and stir to combine. Leave to stand in the pressure cooker for several minutes.
7. Serve topped with extra parmesan and black pepper to taste.

Note: Pictures coming soon! I forgot to take some the past two times I've made this, whoops!
