  <h2>A Review of the Practical Capabilities and Perception of the SixthSense Device</h2>
  <h4>Carlson, Jaimie M., Carlson, Kellie L., & Kuykendall, Benjamin R. (2014). A Review of the Practical Capabilities and Perception of the SixthSense Device. In Proceedings of the International Conferences on Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction 2014, Game and Entertainment Technologies 2014, and Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2014 (pp. 61-68). IADIS. </h4>
  <h4><b>Abstract: </b>With advances in sensing and processing input, more natural interfaces have been developed; gesture based input is now within the capacities of current technology. Despite prototype devices developed in the past five years, consumer electronics have not adapted gesture-based input systems. This study replicates the SixthSense technology, a wearable gesture- based interface, as developed by Pranav Mistry at the MIT Media Lab (Mistry et al.). We determined how high school students, a group accustomed to modern hand-held technology, perceive this device. Subjects (n=19) assessed the practicality of the device after hearing a general description, after operating a prototype device, and after watching a video featuring possible future uses of the device. Numerical trends and individual reactions were evaluated. Significant differences were observed in reactions after the three stages of the experiment (p<0.05). These differences highlighted the flaws in the execution and design of current gesture-based device prototypes.</h4>
