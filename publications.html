  <h3>A Review of the Practical Capabilities and Perception of the SixthSense Device</h3>

  <h5><b>Abstract: </b>With advances in sensing and processing input, more natural interfaces have been developed; gesture based input is now within the capacities of current technology. Despite prototype devices developed in the past five years, consumer electronics have not adapted gesture-based input systems. This study replicates the SixthSense technology, a wearable gesture- based interface, as developed by Pranav Mistry at the MIT Media Lab (Mistry et al.). We determined how high school students, a group accustomed to modern hand-held technology, perceive this device. Subjects (n=19) assessed the practicality of the device after hearing a general description, after operating a prototype device, and after watching a video featuring possible future uses of the device. Numerical trends and individual reactions were evaluated. Significant differences were observed in reactions after the three stages of the experiment (p<0.05). These differences highlighted the flaws in the execution and design of current gesture-based device prototypes.</h5>

  <h3>Changing Speed and Pitch of Synthesized Voices: Perceived Effects on Attributes and Retention</h3>
  <h5>Carlson, J., Carlson, K., Kurian, M., Agrawal, N., Xiang, A. & Brown, D. (2012). Changing Speed and Pitch of Synthesized Voices: Perceived Effects on Attributes and Retention. In Proceedings of Global Learn 2012 (pp. 239-244). AACE.  </h5>
  <h5><b>Abstract: </b>Computer-synthesized voices can help students learn information via recorded lectures or study aids. This experiment seeks to determine how differences in speed and pitch among synthesized voices affect students’ opinions about the voices and how well they remembered informative passages read by the voices. In the experiment, participants listened to five versions of a computerized voice, modified in speed and pitch, reading randomized passages. Subjects were asked to fill out questionnaires regarding characteristics and information from the passages. The data suggests that affective considerations are more prevalent than retention concerns when accumulating information from computerized voices.</h5>
