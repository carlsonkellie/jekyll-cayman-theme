  <p><h3> Hi and welcome to my food blog! I'm Kellie, and I'm a nerdy computer science student who loves to cook in her free time. This is my creative outlet, from the code of this website to the recipes that I'm sharing with you!
  <br>
    The name of this blog (courtesy of my wonderful sister) stems from my fairly recent affinity for using a pressure cooker. Not only does it produce delicious food, but it's also a life saver when I spend my days running around campus and then want something fast and easy when I get back to my dorm.
  <br>
    I'm a food enthusiast who enjoys trying all kinds of recipes, but I also often find myself sticking to my Italian roots and loving to cook those meals the most (especially when I'm with my family). I'm also a huge chocolate fanatic (dark chocolate, anyone?), and I try to find any excuse to throw it into a dessert.
  <br>
    Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy!</h3></p>
  <h5>*Please note, this website is still under development, so the pressure cooker recipes tab is not yet functional</h5>
